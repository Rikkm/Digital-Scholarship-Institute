## The Curriculum
The DSI curriculum will be structured around two cohort groups.

Both groups will start Day 1 together with welcoming remarks, a keynote address by Jennifer Vinopal, introductions, and logistical information, followed by [Introduction to Digital Scholarship](/introDS) in the afternoon.

Days 2–4 will be spent in the cohort groups, with each group spending a half-day on each of the following topics:

### Day 2: June 6
* [Archives & Exhibitions with Omeka](/Archives%20and%20Exhibitions)
* [Multimodal Online Publishing with Scalar](/Multimodal%20Online%20Publishing%20with%20Scalar)

### Day 3: June 7
* [Geospatial and Temporal Mapping with Carto](/Geospatial%20and%20Temporal%20Mapping%20with%20Carto)
* [Information Visualization](/Information%20Visualization)

### Day 4: June 8
* [Text Analysis: Concordances, Word Trends, & Word Clouds with Voyant Tools](/Text%20Analysis)
* [Scholarly Editions: Text Encoding and Publishing with TEI](/Scholarly%20Editions)

Day 5, June 9th, will wrap up with [Digital Scholarship Consultations and Pedagogy](/Consultation), a debrief session, and some post-institute planning for continued online meetups. 

There may be opportunities to extend learning on one or more of the evenings if participants are interested in developing spontaneous groups for further study or play. Timely breaks to re-charge, and community-building receptions, will also be included in the experience.

### Learning Goals
The learning goals set forth by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) Digital Scholarship Institute are meant to uphold the overarching goal of the ARL Academy, which has been created to “foster the development of an agile, diverse and highly-motivated workforce as well as the inspiring leadership necessary to meet present and future challenges.”

By the end of the institute, participants will:

* describe how digital scholarship fits into higher education and why academic libraries are engaging in digital scholarship
* demonstrate confidence in their ability to engage with digital scholarship projects by developing strategies for advancing their roles as contributors, as partners and/or co-creators in digital scholarship projects
* identify the hallmarks of digital scholarship/critical elements and methodological principles that qualifies scholarly work as digital scholarship
* evaluate different digital scholarship methodologies and tools
* integrate existing skillsets into those needed for digital scholarship
* envision digital scholarship as a collaborative endeavor by identifying individual researchers or local institutional units with whom they feel confident working to continue furthering their knowledge and practice of digital scholarship
* establish an integrated cohort as part of this institute to cultivate ongoing  knowledge-sharing, skill-building, and networking during and beyond the institute

## The Institute
The ARL Digital Scholarship Institute (DSI), an exciting new initiative of the ARL Academy, is a five-day, cohort-based opportunity for professionals in ARL member libraries who are new to digital scholarship to develop their skills in an intensive, yet supportive, learner-centered environment. Guided by the principles of community, diversity, impact, openness, and sustainability, the Digital Scholarship Institute will foreground critical thinking about the content and context of the modern research ecosystem. Participants will be trained in a core set of methodologies and tools that will provide both a knowledge base and the confidence to work through the cultural changes sweeping through academic libraries and higher education today.

The first iteration of the ARL Digital Scholarship Institute will take place June 5–9, 2017, at the Connors Center in Dover, Massachusetts, and is hosted by the Boston College Libraries. The ARL Digital Scholarship Institute is co-sponsored by the following institutions: Boston College Libraries; the University Library, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Indiana University Libraries; River Campus Libraries, the University of Rochester; and UC San Diego Libraries.

## Code of Conduct
The ARL Digital Scholarship Institute is committed to creating and supporting an inclusive community of practice. Please see our complete [Code of Conduct](/Code%20of%20Conduct.md).
