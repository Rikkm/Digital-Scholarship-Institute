# **Exercise 1**

## **Create a basic map with points (30 - 40 minutes)**

This first exercise will be demonstrated by the instructor, step by step, and then participants will attempt to visualize this dataset and explore the Carto UI.

1. Login to the [Carto](https://carto.com/) dashboard
   * Find "Your datasets" where you will upload new datasets.
   * Find "Your maps" where you will be able to see your published maps.

2. Go to the [City of Boston Open Data Buildings](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/buildings) dataset and download the **CSV file.**

3. In your Carto dashboard go to "Datasets" and click on "New Dataset"
   * Select your file "Buildings.csv" and click on "Connect Dataset" to upload it
   * Click on the dataset in your dashboard and you will be able to view the table
   * Find the Part_Center and Part_Center_1 columns (Q, R)
      * Click on the three vertical dots next to the column header "Part_Center" and select "rename column." Rename it to "Longitude."
      * Click on the three vertical dots next to the column header "Part_Center_1" and select "rename column." Rename it to "Latitude."
   * Click on "Create map" (bottom right corner)

4. You will now see a map view with a sidebar with layers and widgets
   * You should see "positron labels," "buildings,", and "positron – basemap"
   * Your buildings map will not have any points, because it is not georeferenced.

5. Let's georeference your map
   * Click on the **Buildings** layer in the sidebar and then the "georeference" button.
   * In the "Parameters" section – identify the columns that contain latitude and longitude values. Click "apply."

6. Your map now has points!
   * Zoom in to Boston to see the points on your map.
   * You'll notice that your sidebar now has additional menu items
     * Data, Analysis, Style, Pop-up, Legend
     * We will return to these items later.
   * Notice that you can toggle between your data table and map view in the bottom right corner of your map.
