# **Exercise 4**

## **Use Widgets and Analysis Tools (20-30 minutes)**

1.  **Widgets**

    * Choose a layer and go into the "data" menu
    * You will see the option to "add as a widget" the values in each column for that data table. Select a widget that you'd like to explore.
    * For example, in the Historic Districts dataset, select "place_name" and in the Buildings dataset, select "elevation_sea_level"
    * You will see a sidebar appear to the right of your map with the data from the column you selected as a widget.
    * Repeat with other layers.
    * View all of your widgets in the sidebar under "Widgets"
      * You can easily delete a widget
      * You can also edit your widget type and configure the values
      * If you want your widget to interact with the data â€“ set it as dynamic
    * You'll notice that as you zoom or pan across your map, the data point totals will adjust to reflect the values that are represented by a specific widget.

2. **Analysis**

    * Create areas of influence to identify the distance between each building (radius 10, tracts 1)
      * In the Buildings layer, select "analysis" and click on the + sign in "Your Workflow"
      * Select "create areas of influence" and click on "add analysis"
      * In "parameters" identify whether you want to use distance of time, units, radius, and tracts. Select "apply."
    * You will notice that the icons have now disappeared and instead there will be fine points with consistent spaces.

### **Other data layers to explore**

[2010 U.S. Census - Environmental Justice Populations](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/cen2010ej.html) (download zip file and add _SH.zip extension before uploading into Carto)
    * View median household income  (Med_HH_Inc) across Boston
    * View low income ("I") category
