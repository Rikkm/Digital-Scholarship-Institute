# Exercise 2: Describe items and arrange into themes

## Instructions

1. Workshop facilitators will pass out sample items printed on handouts.

2. Working individually, describe 1â€“2 items by filling out metadata fields (e.g. title, subject) printed on the handout. Reference the [spreadsheet of sample collection items](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPg8tbS3cpTgDvEJ6lGOPQawPZnXMW0YEYgtJYfY850/edit?usp=sharing) in order to locate a clickable URL for each image, from which you can glean clues for the description of your item.

3. Working in groups of ~5, arrange cards into possible thematic groups.

4. A representative of each small group will share design decisions made while describing and arranging, as well as any outstanding questions, with all workshop participants.

## What do these metadata fields mean?!

Out of the box, Omeka uses Dublin Core elements as metadata fields, one of the sets of [Dublin Core terms](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms). We have provided some guidance on what these fields mean below. For a deeper dive, consult [Working with Dublin Core in Omeka](https://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core) and [Using the Dublin Core Elements](http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml).

| Metadata Field | Definition | Notes on Usage |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| dc.title | Name of the item you are describing. | Establish conventions, e.g. sentence case vs. title case, supplied information in brackets, etc. |
| dc.creator | The person or organization primarily responsible for making the item you are describing, e.g., artist, author. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html), [Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), or the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org). |
| dc.contributor | Person or organization responsible for making contributions to the resource, e.g. illustrator. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html), [Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), or the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org). |
| dc.date | Point or period of time associated with the item, e.g. date original item was created. | Use the [international standard for date and time formats](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html), e.g. 2017-01-01, which is nicely summarized in this [W3C note on date and time formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). |
| dc.description | A free-text account of the item you are describing. | A good place for information that doesn't fit in other, more structured metadata fields. |
| dc.rights | Information about the rights status of the item. | Use standard descriptions such as [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses) or the statements from [RightsStatements.org](http://rightsstatements.org/en). |
| dc.subject | Topic of the item you are describing. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) or [Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM)](http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials.html). |
| dc.coverage | The spatial or temporal topic of the item being described: instead of the place or date when the item was created, the place or date that an item is about, e.g. the event that a monument commemorates. | For spatial topics, use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn). For temporal topics, use a structured format similar to that for dc.date. |
| dc.publisher | Person or organization responsible for making the item available. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html), [Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), or the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org). |
| dc.relation | Citation of a related item. | Include URL to item, e.g., if it appears in another digital collection. |
| dc.source | Citation to where this item was found, e.g. collecting institution or or print resource. | Include URL to item, e.g., if it appears in another digital collection. |
| dc.format | Physical medium, file format, or dimensions of the item. | Use a controlled vocabulary, such as the [Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat). |
| dc.type | Nature or genre of the item. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as the [DCMI Type Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#H7). |
| dc.language | A language of the item. | Use a controlled vocabulary such as [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt). According to this specification English as used in the United States would en-US. Otherwise, just be consistent! |
| dc.identifier | An unambiguous reference to the item. | E.g. file name or URI. |
