# Consultation Session

## Scenario
Professor K from the History department is researching the globalization of the United States between 1780-1880.   

Professor K is consulting historical maps and atlases during this time period and compiling data that track 
military deployment, diplomatic missions, commerce/trade, largely from secondary publications, mainly monographs.  

Professor K would like to analyze and visualize the data he’s compiling to help him with a book he’s writing.  
He would also like create a digital archive of the secondary sources he’s referencing for data collection, 
which would include his online visualizations as a companion to his published open-access book.
