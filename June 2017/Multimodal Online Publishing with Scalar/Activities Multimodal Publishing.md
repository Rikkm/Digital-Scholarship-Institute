## ACTIVITY 1: Site Analysis
* In groups of 2-3, look at the two multimodal publications assigned to your group.
* Identify common features and structures, and issues that you think might be common concerns (in terms of process, information organization, social and legal concerns, technical requirements) with the two different sites. 
* Also identify areas where the two sites diverge in their focus, methods/approach, and/or tools used.
