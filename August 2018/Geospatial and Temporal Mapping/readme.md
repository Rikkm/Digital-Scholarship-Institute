## Workshop Agenda
- Introduction to Spatial Thinking (20 mins)
- Project Showcase (15 mins): We will review some digital scholarship projects that utilize mapping and GIS to give a better understanding of the wide application for these tools and methods.
- [How Did They Make That? Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TuXzYJrc11GiavUeV6WfzoQvXIy1oddSYjrRm0W7BBk/edit?usp=sharing) (20 mins): In groups, we will analyze a current GIS project in order to understand its audience, the expertise that would be necessary to create the project, and how you might help support such a project.
- Group Discussion (15 mins)
- [Georectify Historical Maps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1g5nmp6VndB0RPFw2LJ0b_s6IU6iGYFvHzTOTqak_4/edit?usp=sharing) (20 mins): We will learn how to identify places on a scanned, image based map in order to place it on a coordinate system so that it can be used in combination with other data layers.
- Break (30 mins)
- [ArcGIS Online Introduction](https://github.com/tech-at-arl/Digital-Scholarship-Institute/blob/master/August%202018/Geospatial%20and%20Temporal%20Mapping/ArcGIS%20Introduction.md) (60 mins): We will learn the basics of ArcGIS online, including creating a new map, navigating the interface, searching for and adding layers, changing the style, working with attributes, and map notes. We will also work in groups to propose a new location for a Indianapolis branch library based on analysis of local population, public transportation, current locations, etc.
