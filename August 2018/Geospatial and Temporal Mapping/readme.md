Workshop Agenda:

- Project Showcase (15 mins): We will review some digital scholarship projects that utilize mapping and GIS to give a better understanding of the wide application for these tools and methods.
- How Did They Make That? Exercise (20 mins): In groups, we will analyze a current GIS project in order to understand its audience, the expertise that would be necessary to create the project, and how you might help support such a project.
- Group Discussion (15 mins)
- Georectify Historical Maps (20 mins): We will learn how to identify places on a scanned, image based map in order to place it on a coordinate system so that it can be used in combination with other data layers.
