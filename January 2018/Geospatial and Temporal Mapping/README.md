## Introduction and Learning Goals

In this session we will introduce the concept of "thinking spatially" as well as a few tools and concepts commonly used when engaging in spatial projects.  None of the tools will be covered in depth but rather you will get exposed to several different commonly used tools with an emphasis on the "spatial thinking" required when using these tools.

## Schedule
1. Introduction to mapping and thinking spatially
2. Georeference Historical Map â€“ Map Warper OR David Rumsey
3. Omeka and Neatline
4. Break 
5. Open Refine and Geocoding
7. ArcGIS Online and analysis and publishing
8. Group Discussion
