To be completed (prior to Friday, January 12): Please read this article in preparation for our workshop on digital consultations (for research or pedagogy) - [Beyond buttonology: Digital humanities, digital pedagogy, and the ACRL Framework](http://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/view/16833/18427). This can be a quick, interesting read while you travel, can provide some food for thought prior to the Jan 12 workshop, and is sure to resonate with librarians who have been working to incorporate the ACRL Framework into their teaching practice.
