Welcome to the session on multimodal online publishing with Scalar!

For this workshop, we will be using the online multimodal publishing platform Scalar. You will access this through a free online account and do not need to download anything in advance of the workshop. Due to security issues Scalar is currently experiencing, you'll register with a key at the workshop itself. However, if you want to look at existing Scalar sites, you can explore their website and showcase at https://scalar.me/anvc/
