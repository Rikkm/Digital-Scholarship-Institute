Welcome to the session on multimodal online publishing with Scalar! This session is led by Harriett Green and Dan Tracy from the University Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

For this workshop, we will be using the online multimodal publishing platform Scalar. You will access this through a free online account and do not need to download anything in advance of the workshop. Due to security issues Scalar is currently experiencing, you'll register with a key at the workshop itself. However, if you want to look at existing Scalar sites, you can explore their website and showcase at https://scalar.me/anvc/
