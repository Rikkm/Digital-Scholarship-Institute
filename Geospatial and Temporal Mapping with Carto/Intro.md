This document presents an overview of the lesson, which includes a discussion of mapping basics through visualization examples, a visualization task, datasets for the lesson, and the goals and learning outcomes.

The lesson will consist of four hands-on exercises:

* [Exercise 1](exercise-1.md): Create a basic map with points
* [Exercise 2](exercise-2.md): Review and normalize data
* [Exercise 3](exercise-3.md): Create layers and add polygons to your map
* [Exercise 4](exercise-4.md): Use Widgets and Analysis Tools

A [resources document](resources.md) is also included with select readings, tutorials, datasets, and additional resources.

# **Mapping Basics**

We will look at several examples of geospatial visualizations to demonstrate and discuss the following questions:

* What are points, lines, polygons, layers?
* What are common formats for GIS data?
* Why would you use points vs. polygons in a map? 
* What kind of data can you visualize?

Examples of geospatial visualizations:

* [Musical Map - Cities of the World ](https://eliotvb.carto.com/viz/971d1556-0959-11e5-b1a4-0e9d821ea90d/embed_map)

* [This is Net Neutrality](https://www.thisisnetneutrality.org/)

* [Anti-eviction Mapping Project](http://www.antievictionmappingproject.net/ellis.html)

# **Visualization Task**

We want to identify all of the historic landmarks in Boston and compare them to designated historic districts. We would also like to plot all of the buildings in Boston and see what their current sea-level elevation is. Finally, we are interested in visualizing the impact of the proposed rise in sea level over the next 100 years on these different areas within the City of Boston. Questions we might be able to answer, include:

* Which historic districts and landmarks will be most affected by sea level rise?

* How do building heights compare to the areas where sea levels will rise?

* How many buildings are below sea level elevation?

* What other datasets might be relevant and useful to explore in order to ask questions about Boston area demographics, socio-economic issues, etc.?

* Where do you find open data sets?

* Where do you find place-names with coordinates?

# **Datasets**

We will be using data from the [City of Boston Open Data](https://data.boston.gov/group/geospatial). The following datasets will be used:

* [Buildings](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/buildings) Download CSV format

* [Boston Landmarks Commission Historic Districts](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-landmarks-commission-blc-historic-districts) Download Shapefile format

* [Boston Landmarks Commission Landmarks](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-landmarks-commission-blc-landmarks) Download CSV format

* [Sea level rise plus 5 feet](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/sea-level-rise-plus-5-feet) Download Shapefile format


# **Goals & Learning Outcomes**

Participants will:

* identify appropriate data type(s) and format(s) in order to assess possible visualization/analysis of the data; and to select appropriate tools and options in Carto;

* practice creating a map with points, polygons, and layers in order to
understand the building blocks of geospatial visualization and become familiar with the Carto UI;

* work through exercises in order to develop their understanding of how layers, widgets, and analysis tools work in Carto;

* discuss the process of creating geospatial visualizations in order to identify and understand particular needs of this type of project, as well as potential collaborators and skills.
